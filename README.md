# WatcomBin
Some of the WatcomC++ projects directly as a DOS (e.g. FreeDOS) exe file.

- 4paint.exe a simple 320x200 paint program with the Commodore Plus/4 palette.  
- _sprite.exe a simple but versatile sprite paint program (not finished). (only "16:9 Monitor" (e.g. not DosBox))
- _winsprite.exe _sprite.exe on Windows.
- vcode.exe a 640x480 Norton Commander like text editor with syntax highlighting. (has some (not harmful) bugs in the Norton part)
